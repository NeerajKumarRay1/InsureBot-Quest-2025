# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical timing issue where JavaScript code attempts to manipulate DOM elements before they are fully loaded and available in the document. The current implementation causes blank pages and missing animations because element selectors (like .card, .faq-section) are executed immediately when the script loads, potentially before the target elements exist in the DOM.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want all page animations and styling to display correctly every time I load the page, so that I have a consistent and visually appealing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN all JavaScript-driven animations SHALL execute successfully
2. WHEN DOM elements are targeted by JavaScript THEN the elements SHALL exist before manipulation attempts
3. WHEN the page renders THEN no blank screens SHALL occur due to timing issues
4. WHEN animations are applied THEN they SHALL be visible to the user consistently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want JavaScript code to execute only after DOM elements are ready, so that element selection and manipulation always succeeds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript attempts to select elements THEN the DOM SHALL be fully constructed
2. WHEN DOMContentLoaded event fires THEN all element manipulation code SHALL execute
3. WHEN the script loads before DOM completion THEN execution SHALL be deferred until ready
4. WHEN multiple scripts target DOM elements THEN they SHALL all wait for DOM readiness

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust solution that works across different browsers and loading scenarios, so that the fix is reliable in all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads in any modern browser THEN the DOM timing fix SHALL work consistently
2. WHEN the page loads with slow network conditions THEN animations SHALL still execute properly
3. WHEN the page loads with cached resources THEN timing issues SHALL not occur
4. WHEN the DOM is already loaded before script execution THEN the code SHALL execute immediately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the existing functionality while fixing the timing issue, so that no features are lost during the fix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the timing fix is applied THEN all existing animations SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN element selectors are wrapped in DOM-ready handlers THEN their functionality SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN the fix is implemented THEN no existing JavaScript functionality SHALL be broken
4. WHEN animations execute THEN they SHALL have the same visual effect as intended originally
