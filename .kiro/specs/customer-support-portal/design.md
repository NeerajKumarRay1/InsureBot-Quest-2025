# Design Document: Customer Support Portal

## Overview

The Customer Support Portal will be a comprehensive solution integrated into the existing Valuenable website. It will provide customers with self-service options through a knowledge base, a ticket management system for personalized support, live chat capabilities for immediate assistance, and account management features. The portal will also include an administrative dashboard for support staff to monitor and manage support activities.

## Architecture

The Customer Support Portal will follow a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. The system will be built using a combination of client-side and server-side technologies.

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Error Handling
1. Form validation with clear error messages
2. Graceful handling of network errors with retry options
3. Fallback UI for components that fail to load

### Server-Side Error Handling
1. Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
2. Logging of errors for monitoring and debugging
3. Graceful degradation of services when dependencies are unavailable

### Error Categories and Responses
| Error Category | HTTP Status | User Message | Action |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Authentication | 401 | "Please log in to access this feature" | Redirect to login |
| Authorization | 403 | "You don't have permission to access this resource" | Show limited view |
| Not Found | 404 | "The requested resource was not found" | Show search/navigation options |
| Validation | 422 | "Please check your input and try again" | Highlight invalid fields |
| Server Error | 500 | "Something went wrong. Please try again later" | Retry with exponential backoff |

## Testing Strategy
